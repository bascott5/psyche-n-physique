# To-Do List:
    [x] insert table of contents at the beginning of markdown
    [x] figure out why components are not working with mdx
    [x] use nav bar on the left side of the page to navigate to different page topics in the website
    [] add a search feature that allows the user to navigate in between pages by typing into the search (done by checking the input against every page name, seeing if a substring (based off the size of the input) of the page name is equal to the input) (call it the Gotebook!)
