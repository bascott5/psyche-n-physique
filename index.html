<h2 id="what-is-this-game">What is this game?</h2>
<p><strong>Psyche &amp; Physique</strong> is a general-purpose TTRPG focused on providing a fast, fluid roleplaying experience with an emphasis on minimalism. Every game of Psyche &amp; Physique (or P&amp;P for short) is played with a group of <strong>Players</strong> and a <strong>Gamemaster (GM)</strong>. The Gamemaster&#x27;s role is to provide a narrative experience for the Players, while letting them influence the narrative. Every game mechanic was made to keep low prep time in mind while retaining the consistent narrative structure brought by the GM.</p>
<h2 id="checks">Checks</h2>
<p><strong>Checks</strong> are tests of ability for a character, where a Player must roll dice to decide the outcome whenever the GM allows it. Checks are made with a 1d20, where rolling lesser than or equal to the <strong>Skill</strong> or <strong>Attribute</strong> being tested is a success. Advantage and disadvantage can be applied by the GM depending on the context. If the check is easy, then advantage is given and the player may roll 2d20&#x27;s and take the highest number. If the check is difficult 2d20&#x27;s are still rolled, but the lowest value is accepted.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>When faced with a threat that will cause harm to a character if not dealt with, it is labeled as a <strong>Challenge</strong>. Said threat doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be living, be it a horde of goblins or a giant boulder, anything that will cause damage to a character if nothing is done about it. In the event that multiple characters are facing a challenge, everyone must roll initiative, with those succeeding on the dexterity check being able to go first and the second group of characters who failed going last. Challenges follow the same rules of a <strong>Check</strong> but if the character fails then they may incur some damage. Advantage and disadvantage can be given to represent an easy Challenge and a difficult Challenge respectively. A medium difficulty challenge doesn&#x27;t require advantage nor disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="psyche">Psyche</h2>
<p>Psyche determines your character&#x27;s general mental ability, including their potential for knowledge and persuasion. It is used to determine how strong your character&#x27;s brain is.</p>
<h2 id="physique">Physique</h2>
<p>Physique determines your character&#x27;s physical prowess, including their coordination and muscular ability. It is used to determine how strong your character&#x27;s body is.</p>
<h2 id="body-and-mind">Body and Mind</h2>
<p>There are two separate health systems in Psyche &amp; Physique: body and mind. <strong>Body</strong> is your character&#x27;s fortitude against physical threats (punching, stabbing, etc.) while <strong>Mind</strong> allows them to protect against mental harm (will, terror, morale, etc.). Any <strong>Challenge</strong> and some <strong>Checks</strong> can result in your character taking damage to either of these health pools upon failure. The damage taken to either is dependent on the context of what the character failed to do, with the amount of damage being determined by the GM. In addition, if a character decides to not take action when confronted by a Challenge, they are automatically damaged until they are confronted. If either of these pools are fully depleted, then your character is considered either incapacitated or temporarily taken over by the GM based off their discretion.</p>
<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>Attributes add die to skill rolls depending on the context. There are two Psyche attributes (<strong>Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Charisma</strong>) and two Physique attributes (<strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Dexterity</strong>). Attributes can be added to <strong>Skills</strong> when making a Check or Challenge. The amount of points that can be spent on either Intelligence and Charisma or Strength and Dexterity is equal to Psyche and equal to Physique respectively.</p>
<h2 id="abilities">Abilities</h2>
<p>Abilities are passive traits that a character has that grants them access to some special power that not everyone has. A great example of this could be something like swimming or flight. Every character starts with at least one ability. It doesn&#x27;t have to be anything supernatural either, it can also just be something normal like getting extra inventory space or adding strength as the attribute to a skill that using charisma.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Skills are represented as verbs from a list presented by the GM to keep skills in-line with whatever setting is being played in. Every verb has a corresponding attribute, so when determining the value of the skill, the attribute is added to it. Skills are taken once, but can be increased. The number of points that can be spent on physical skills is equal to Physique and the number of points that can be spent on mental skills is Psyche. Every increase of a skill value lowers the number of points able to be spent on skills by one.</p>
<h2 id="inventory">Inventory</h2>
<p>Inventory is determined by a character&#x27;s Physique score. At character creation, a player can choose between two kits: a Combat Kit and a General Kit. Weapons are generally sorted into four categories: light melee, heavy melee, light range, and heavy range. Light melee and light range consistently deal 1 physical damage, while heavy melee and heavy range deals 3 physical damage, at the drawback that they require two turns to use?</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>There are a variety of ways for a character to die but all of them must include losing all of their body points or mind points, and it depends on the circumstances. For example, a character losing all of their BP trying to punch a hole through a door and failing shouldn&#x27;t result in them dying, rather, they should be in so much pain that they are no longer able to act until they&#x27;re taken to a hospital. However, if a character loses all of their BP after being shot with a gun, they should be dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="optional-rule-humanoids">Optional Rule: Humanoids</h2>
<p>This is an optional rule, since playable non-human characters are not available in every setting. Playing as a humanoid means forgoing a skill point at character creation, but allowing you to get an <strong>Ability</strong> unique to that humanoid.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<ol>
<li>The GM will assign a general amount of points that can be invested into either the Psyche or Physique of the character, but the standard starting amount is 10.</li>
<li>(Optional Rule: Humanoids)</li>
<li>Determine the character&#x27;s <strong>Strength</strong>, <strong>Dexterity</strong>, <strong>Intelligence</strong>, and <strong>Charisma</strong> attributes. The sum of the character&#x27;s Strength and Dexterity score should be equal to their Physique, and the sum of the character&#x27;s Intelligence and Charisma score should be equal to their Psyche.</li>
<li>Determine the character&#x27;s skills. For physical skills, the sum of the number of skills plus points invested into each skill should equal the sum of Physique, and vise versa for mental skills. Make sure to check with the <strong>GM</strong> as to what skills are available.</li>
<li>Determine the character&#x27;s first ability.</li>
<li>Set the character&#x27;s maximum <strong>Body</strong> equal to their Physique / 2 rounding down. The same must be done for <strong>Mind</strong> using Psyche instead of Physique.</li>
<li>Choose an inventory kit, either a weapon kit or a general kit.</li>
<li>Name your character and make sure to write down what setting they belong to.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="for-the-gm">For the GM</h2>
<p>You can structure Challenges by setting parameters for what causes a Challenge to end. Always prioritized on the rule of cool. If unsure how to interpret a rule, just go with what sounds most fun.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-creation">Challenge Creation</h2>
<p>A <strong>Challenge</strong> is made up of two components, the conditions to end the challenge, and the consequences of the challenge if the characters fail to successfully do anything about it.</p>
<h2 id="skill-list">Skill List</h2>

<h2 id="ability-list">Ability List</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon Mastery:</strong> You have honed your ability in a weapon of your choice. Add a skill to your skill list named after the weapon you have chosen and set its value to one. This does not cost any points during <strong>Character Creation</strong>. It is treated as any other skill and is stacked on top of any skill value in the category of the chosen weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Intimidating:</strong> You may add persuasion to your list of skills, but rather than being a <strong>Charisma</strong> skill, it is an <strong>Strength</strong> skill.</li>
<li><strong>Pack Mule</strong>: Increase your inventory space by x2.</li>
<li><strong>Steel Skin:</strong> You get +2 to your <strong>Body&#x27;s</strong> cap.</li>
<li><strong>Mental Fortitude</strong>: You get +2 to your <strong>Mind&#x27;s</strong> cap.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> You are able to cast a variety of small spells, at the <strong>GM&#x27;s</strong> discretion.</li>
<li><strong>Brawler:</strong> Unarmed and improvised weapons are treated as a skill, with the choice of being tied to <strong>Strength</strong> or <strong>Dexterity</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Artisan:</strong> You have focused in on a particular craft of your choice. Add it to your list of skills as an <strong>Intelligence</strong> skill. You can use that skill whenever you are doing anything related to that craft.</li>
<li><strong>Wealthy:</strong> You have an expansive pool of wealth. It may be used as leverage to help in a relevant <strong>Check</strong> or <strong>Challenge</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Skilled:</strong> You gain one additional skill point that you can freely spend on a skill of your choice. This ability can be taken multiple times.</li>
<li><strong>Tactician:</strong> Your <strong>Intelligence</strong> can be used instead of <strong>Dexterity</strong> when determining <strong>Initiative</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Criminal:</strong> You have contacts in low places. These can be leveraged for the sake of bypassing a <strong>Check</strong> if the context applies.</li>
